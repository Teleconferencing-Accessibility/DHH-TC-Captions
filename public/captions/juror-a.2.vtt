00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
without talking about it first.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
How many times have each of us said

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I could kill you for doing that?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Or if you do that once more, I will kill you.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We say it every day.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It doesn't mean we are going to kill someone.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Maybe no reason

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but let's look at this boy's,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
situation. Kicked around all his life,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
his mother died since he was nine,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
his father in and out of jail.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This boy has grown up in

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the school of Hard Knocks.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
He wild, and angry. You know why he's like that?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
because someone knocked

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 him on the head once a day, everyday.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
He's had a pretty terrible 19 years. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We just owned him a few words, that's all.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Well, what if the boy's story is true?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We'd be condemning him to die on false testimony.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
No, but maybe they think they saw

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
something when they really don't.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's possible. The women claimed to see

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the murderer from across the street,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
just as the lights went out.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
She is claiming that she could

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
recognize this boy from 60 feet

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
away as the lights went out.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What if she thought she saw him

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but it was really someone else.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I like to ask you something.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 You don't believe the boy. How 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
come you believe the woman?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 She's one of them too, isn't she?
