00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm saying that it's possible

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The boy claimed he was at the movies.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm asking you could the old man really

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
see the person running down the stairs?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
His vision isn't very good. It was dark.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Is it possible it was someone else?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Is there a reasonable doubt that

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
it could have been someone else?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That's the question.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 You're right!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
She kept rubbing them in the courtroom.
