00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 So it's logical to assume that 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
she was trying to fall asleep

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and look casually out the window

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
she wouldn't see much without her glasses on,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
especially from 60 feet away.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
She wouldn't have seen anything.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Then here's another guess.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Maybe she honestly thought she

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
saw the boy kill his father.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I say that she only saw a blur.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 What's your hurry? Are you his executioner? 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Maybe you'd like to pull the switch

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I feel sorry for you.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What it must feel like to want

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to pull the switch.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Ever since we walked into this

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
room you have been behaving like

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
a self appointed public avenger.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You want to see this boy die

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
because you personally want it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Not because it a

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You're a sadist

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?
