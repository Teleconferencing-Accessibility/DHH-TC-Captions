00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I've lived in a slum all my life.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I used to play in a backyard

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that was filled with garbage.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Maybe it still smells on me!

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
No, that's not right.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Only the woman claimed to have seen it.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The old man only heard the body fall.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 He didn't see the stabbing. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Then he said he saw the kid running

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
down the stairs and out of the house.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So he called the police.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That's true, but the woman was far away,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 wasn't she? About 60 feet.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Why are you rubbing your nose like that?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I want to know why are you rubbing your nose.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Your eyeglasses makes those deep

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
impressions on the sides of your nose.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I never noticed that before.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
They must be annoying.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The woman who testified that she

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
saw the killing had the same

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 marks on the sides of her nose. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
This woman was about fourty-five years old,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 but she tried to look thirty-five. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Did you notice that? All that makeup,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 her hair dyed,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
the brand new clothes and no eyeglasses?
