00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Who says it's easy for me?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The old man heard him yell that he was

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
going to kill his father in his own words.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
He's telling us he did it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The kid said he was going to

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
kill him and he did kill him.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
End of story.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We don't owe him anything. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 The kid's a killer. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 I've listened to words all week, 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the prosecutor,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the defense attorney,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the witnesses.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The judge and don't tell me you're

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
taking this kid's testimony seriously,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
he's a born liar. All his kind are.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
She stood in the courtroom and

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
she said she saw it plain as day.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Why would she lie?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You're a pretty smart fellow, aren't you?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Who made you so wise?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
What are you, the kid's guardian Angel?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
He's got nothing. The woman wouldn't lie.
