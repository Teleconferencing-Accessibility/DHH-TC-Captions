00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 The movies? What a load of crap. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This kid couldn't even remember the names

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of the movies he was supposed to have seen.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Don't you remember the cops testimony?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 I'm telling you. The kid made it all up. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
No one could confirm his alibi.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 This kid stinks of the gutter. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 What do you mean claimed? She saw it. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
He's confusing you.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Is it possible you're wasting our time?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You keep running around in circles.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 What do you mean no eyeglasses?
