00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:45.721
I think we all know that.

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.336
None of us were asleep in there.

00:00:56.752 --> 00:00:58.624
He also said that if there is no

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:00.672
reasonable doubt, he must be found guilty.

00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:01.860
Am I right?

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.501
And this kid is obviously guilty.

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:19.600
I say let's call for a vote.

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:20.772
Let's see where we stand.

00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:41.563
Boy, oh boy.

00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:42.988
There's always one.

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:55.270
 He knifed his

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.722
own father 4 inches into the chest.

00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:00.002
 They proved it a dozen different ways. 

00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:01.622
Do you want me to list them for you?

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:03.100
What do you want?

00:02:11.058 --> 00:02:13.482
No hurry, but this case is pretty obvious.

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:16.002
 Why, I was convinced the first day. 

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.384
What's there to talk about? He's guilty.

00:02:32.882 --> 00:02:34.520
Who says it's easy for me?

00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:36.709
The old man heard him yell that he was

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.306
going to kill his father in his own words.

00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:41.262
He's telling us he did it.

00:02:50.702 --> 00:02:52.263
The kid said he was going to

00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:53.842
kill him and he did kill him.

00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:54.868
End of story.

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:31.237
We don't owe him anything. 

00:03:31.242 --> 00:03:32.626
 The kid's a killer. 

00:03:32.626 --> 00:03:34.356
 I've listened to words all week, 

00:03:34.362 --> 00:03:35.090
the prosecutor,

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.182
the defense attorney,

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:36.798
the witnesses.

00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:38.954
The judge and don't tell me you're

00:03:38.954 --> 00:03:41.031
taking this kid's testimony seriously,

00:03:41.032 --> 00:03:43.297
he's a born liar. All his kind are.

00:04:37.372 --> 00:04:38.980
She stood in the courtroom and

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.029
she said she saw it plain as day.

00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:42.157
 Why would she lie?

00:04:50.922 --> 00:04:52.816
You're a pretty smart fellow, aren't you?

00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:54.601
Who made you so wise?

00:04:54.602 --> 00:04:56.800
What are you, the kid's guardian Angel?

00:04:56.802 --> 00:04:59.602
He's got nothing. The woman wouldn't lie.

00:04:59.602 --> 00:05:01.109
She has no reason to.

00:05:14.132 --> 00:05:16.351
 The movies? What a load of crap. 

00:05:16.352 --> 00:05:18.354
This kid couldn't even remember the names

00:05:18.354 --> 00:05:20.777
of the movies he was supposed to have seen.

00:05:20.782 --> 00:05:23.152
Don't you remember the cops testimony?

00:05:23.152 --> 00:05:25.798
 I'm telling you. The kid made it all up. 

00:05:25.802 --> 00:05:27.878
No one could confirm his alibi.

00:05:27.882 --> 00:05:29.700
 This kid stinks of the gutter. 

00:05:56.932 --> 00:05:59.740
 What do you mean claimed? She saw it. 

00:05:59.742 --> 00:06:00.786
He's confusing you.

00:06:20.552 --> 00:06:22.708
Is it possible you're wasting our time?

00:06:22.712 --> 00:06:24.496
You keep running around in circles.

00:07:26.812 --> 00:07:28.690
 What do you mean no eyeglasses? 

00:07:28.692 --> 00:07:30.543
You don't know that she wore glasses

00:07:30.543 --> 00:07:32.470
 just because she was rubbing her nose.

00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:00.865
You don't know what kind of glasses she wore.

00:08:00.872 --> 00:08:02.770
You're guessing! they could have been

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.521
 sunglasses. 

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:13.304
You haven't convinced anyone.

00:08:13.304 --> 00:08:14.944
 I call for another vote. 

00:08:20.022 --> 00:08:22.156
For this kid? You bet I would. 

00:08:31.963 --> 00:08:33.250
Listen, you shut up.

00:08:33.252 --> 00:08:35.076
I'm telling you now shut up.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.845
Shut up.

00:08:40.992 --> 00:08:42.618
Shut up or I'll kill you.
