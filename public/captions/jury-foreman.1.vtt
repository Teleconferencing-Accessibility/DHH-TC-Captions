00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Alright, let's get started.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You heard what the judge said.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One man is dead and now we must decide

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
if another man will live or die.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Premeditated murder is the most

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
serious charge in our courts,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and if we vote guilty,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we have to send him to the electric chair.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That's mandatory.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it's a standard procedure

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to lock the doors.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
They don't want anyone sneaking out.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 As I was saying, 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If there is a reasonable doubt.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We have to find him not guilty.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Yes, well,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I just want to make sure that we have a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
clearer idea about why we're all here,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
since this is a serious matter.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Our verdict must be unanimous one

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
way or another, guilty or not guilty.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 That's just the law.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I say let's call for a vote.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Let's see where we stand.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
No?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Ok. Well.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This has to be a four to nothing vote.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Either way.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Are we ready?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
all those voting guilty raise your hand.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
OK,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
not guilty.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
One OK.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
3 to 1 guilty. Now we know where we stand.
