00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.433
Alright, let's get started.

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:06.131
You heard what the judge said.

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:09.456
One man is dead and now we must decide

00:00:09.456 --> 00:00:13.033
if another man will live or die.

00:00:14.457 --> 00:00:16.173
Premeditated murder is the most

00:00:16.173 --> 00:00:17.703
serious charge in our courts,

00:00:17.703 --> 00:00:19.021
and if we vote guilty,

00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:21.316
we have to send him to the electric chair.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.381
That's mandatory.

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.461
it's a standard procedure

00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:34.077
to lock the doors.

00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:35.710
They don't want anyone sneaking out.

00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:37.392
 As I was saying, 

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:40.574
If there is a reasonable doubt.

00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:42.830
We have to find him not guilty.

00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:48.811
Yes, well,

00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:51.883
I just want to make sure that we have a

00:00:51.883 --> 00:00:54.249
clearer idea about why we're all here,

00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:56.850
since this is a serious matter.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.721
Our verdict must be unanimous one

00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:16.503
way or another, guilty or not guilty.

00:01:16.503 --> 00:01:17.844
 That's just the law.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.134
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:26.081
No?

00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:28.081
Ok. Well.

00:01:29.262 --> 00:01:31.355
This has to be a four to nothing vote.

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:33.590
Either way.

00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:35.294
Are we ready?

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.590
all those voting guilty raise your hand.

00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:44.311
OK,

00:01:44.818 --> 00:01:45.375
not guilty.

00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:48.381
One OK.

00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:54.333
3 to 1 guilty. Now we know where we stand.

00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:01.569
Yeah, I actually agree.

00:03:01.913 --> 00:03:02.851
Let's hear your reasons

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.836
Don't take it personally. 

00:03:51.211 --> 00:03:53.164
We're all adults here.

00:03:54.306 --> 00:03:56.103
Let's just get straight to the facts.

00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:05.891
Surely you're not suggesting that

00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:07.801
 all the witnesses were lying, 

00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:08.301
 are you? 

00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:03.597
I actually agree with you.

00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:06.681
Why would she perjure herself?

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:07.793
She has nothing to gain.

00:05:38.624 --> 00:05:39.124
Guys.

00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:43.223
Let's just be reasonable.

00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:49.112
The facts are. Two witnesses saw

00:05:49.112 --> 00:05:52.779
him stab his father at 12:10 AM.

00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:32.138
The old man could have seen him.

00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:33.716
 He wasn't that far away.

00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:45.822
Well.

00:06:46.437 --> 00:06:47.706
If it's any of your business,

00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:52.127
I was rubbing it because it was bothering me.

00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:55.455
It's because of my glasses now

00:06:55.455 --> 00:06:57.183
could we get on to something else?

00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:33.000
Listen.

00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:35.421
I saw them too.

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.840
I was the closest one to her

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.740
and she had those marks.

00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:49.381
 Another vote 

00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:51.544
has been called for.

00:08:52.909 --> 00:08:53.686
Let's vote.

00:08:54.898 --> 00:08:55.498
Guilty?

00:08:57.741 --> 00:08:58.241
OK.

00:08:59.146 --> 00:08:59.820
 Not guilty?
